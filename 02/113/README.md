# Elements we know so far
Here are a few common HTML elements we can use to begin writing and structuring our content.

## Text elements (blocks)
- `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`: Headings makeup the outline for our document
- `p`: Paragraphs hold much of our document's text content
- `li`: List items (use with order or unordered lists)
- `dt`, `dd`: Definition term and description (use with definition lists)

## Text elements (inline)
- `strong`, `em`: Identifying important content (keywords)
- `a href="#"`: Link to another page ("anchor"), with the url set to the `href` attribute

## Lists containers
- `ol`: ordered lists
- `ul`: unordered lists
- `dl`: definition lists

## Sectioning containers
- `header`, `footer`: Wraps leading or closing content for its parent
- `main`: The most important part of our document (only one per document)
- `article`: Groups text elements. Contextually can stand-alone
- `section`: Groups text elements. Typically paired with other related sections
- `nav`: Primary internal navigation container
- `aside`: Secondary related content
- `div`: Generic group, mostly used for styling (or when there are no better options)
