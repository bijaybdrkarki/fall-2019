# Grid Practice

Using the "News" layout we created last week:

  1.  Remove any properties that would restrict the size of a `.news` article, or would put the element `inline`
  2.  Setup a grid template such that the `.news` items are all able to sit beside each other at all times
  3.  (BONUS) Space the `.news` items from eachother so that there's `1em` of space between them horizontally
      - Hint: You know one method already, but there is also a grid specific property to space the cells in a grid from each other, see if you can find it using the reference sites you visit most frequently.
